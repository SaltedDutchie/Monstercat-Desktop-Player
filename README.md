Temporary fix: Run the program in administrator mode.



The Monstercat desktop player gives users easier access to the Monstercat website through their desktop. Unlike the normal browser, the desktop player uses less of your computers resources, making it easier for your computer to run games while you listen to music! The program also inclues features like Discord RPC which features the song you are currently playing on your Discord profile (example below)! It also writes the current song you are listening to into a text file, making it easy to display your song on your Twitch stream!
